This is a very basic Calculator made with Swift 5.2 and UIKit.
This UI supports different orientation in any iOS devices.
It can be used to teach students:
  i) Auto layout with contraints for different size iPhone/iPad devices with UIKit
  ii) Managing Appicons for all possible iPhone devices
  
  
(iPhone simulator still doesn't support touch gesture to get recorderd :/ )
